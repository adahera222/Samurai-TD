This game is called "Samurai TD" which is a TD game combining elements from RTS.
It is targeted for the iOS platform.

It's developed based on Cocos2d-x game engine.

IMPORTANT: Now the project is still under development.
            Now the game scene can only display the map and samurais walking from outside into the screen with animation.


In the current version v0.3 (which sounds like a very very early prototype and it is), the engine has achieved these:
  
  #1 Component-Entity based design    (NOTE: which needs improved later, make it more flexible like Unity3D)

  #2 Collision detection              (NOTE: binary space partitioning is employed)
 
  #3 Finite state machine             (NOTE: I have been thinking replacing FSM with Action List)

  #4 Support lua script               (NOTE: limited support only, need to improve)

  #5 Support external map editor      (NOTE: only "Tiled" is supported now and I think it's enough)

  #6 Other small features.




This game is called "Samurai TD" which is a TD game combining elements from RTS.

"Samurai TD" tells a story about a samurai, ancient Japanese warrior, protects a village from caterans. The game is intended to pay respect to the great movie "The Seven Samurai" and the great game "Kingdom Rush".

Basically, the player build towers in the pre-determined slots along the paths through which the enemies will walk. The towers will attack the enemies automatically. What makes it also a RTS game is one of the towers the player can build is the "Tavern" which spawns soldiers to block and attack the enemies. Player can move the soldiers spawned within a certain range around the "Tavern", and this brings a lot of strategic thinking during the game play. Also, a hero (our main role) can also be controlld to fight the enemies.

Hope you would like it !
